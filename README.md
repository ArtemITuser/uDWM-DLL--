# UDWM-DLL-Switcher
Batch script to switch the different versions of the uDWM.dll file

This script is intended to work ONLY under Windows 10 21H2 and 22H2 ; Do not try to use it with other versions.

Simply move uDWM.dll.bak2 and uDWM.dll.bak3 to the C:\Windows\system32 folder. Then, get all permissions on the file C:\windows\system32\uDWM.dll
The script is supposed to work after that. I tested this on my main system, running Windows 10 21H2. I take no responsibility if it doesn't work for you; it is strongly advised to save the uDWM.dll file before any modification.

All credits is to Mexicancatgirl/Dulappy, who modified the uDWM.dll to look similar to Windows 7 and Windows 8.
