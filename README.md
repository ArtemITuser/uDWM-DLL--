# UDWM-DLL-Switcher
Batch script to switch the different versions of the uDWM.dll file

This script is intended to work ONLY under Windows 10 21H2 and 22H2.
Simply move uDWM.dll.bak2 and uDWM.dll.bak3 to the C:\Windows\system32 folder. Then, get all permissions on the file C:\windows\system32\uDWM.dll
The script is supposed to work after that. I tested this on my main system, running Windows 10. I take no responsibility if it doesn't work for you; it is strongly advised to save the uDWM.dll file before any modification.
All credits to Mexicancatgirl/Dulappy, who modified the uDWM file to look similar to Windows 7 and Windows 8.
